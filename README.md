# Batteries (included)

Tired of copying the same Rake tasks to every single Roda/Sinatra project you
start? Me too.

Use batteries to get a head start.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'batteries'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install batteries

## Usage

Incorporate the Batteries Rake tasks into your Rakefile

    Batteries::Tasks.new
